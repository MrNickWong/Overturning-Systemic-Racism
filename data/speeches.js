      'Although it may be argued that there is a basic fund of goodwill towards this country [Australia] in many of the  islands, we have to recognise that particularly in Fiji, persistent criticisms arise from a combination of factors:  Australia’s restrictive immigration policy (in the face of island over-population and limited employment  opportunities, especially for educated islanders)…Australia’s heavily and in most cases increasingly favourable  balance of trade with the region; the association of individual Australians with racially discriminatory practices in  the islands themselves. In all, there is a tendency to feel that Australia’s attitudes to the islands are dominated by  selfish concentration on its own interests in the region, principally commercial profit, and that Australia takes too  little account of the wider interests in the welfare and progress of the Pacific community.',

      "Now this is important because as more children go through the early childhood education system, we're going to need more people trained and qualified to do the work. Our existing early childhood educators aren't paid as well as they should be and we'll have more to say about that in the future. They're qualified, they're skilled, and they look after the most precious things in our lives, our kids.",

      'When Australia, the Empire, and liberty were threatened with destruction, we acted as Australians who stood loyally by the Empire, as lovers of liberty, prepared to sacrifice all things for country and liberty. I was expelled because I chose to tread the narrow path of duty. It has proved a hard and bitter one. I was under no illusions as to the consequences of my action. I knew that it meant ostracism, breaking with an organisation to which I had devoted my life, incurring the bitter, implacable hatred of a powerful section of the community. I knew that I risked not only my position as leader, but my very existence as a public man. I saw quite clearly that I was turning my back upon a safe, easy, and profitable path which the unremitting efforts of years had cleared for me. I had but to temporise, to pose as the patriot, and to drug my conscience, and all would have been well for me. I should have been in an impregnable position.',

      'Three years ago Australians relied upon the Labor Government to maintain unswerving commitment to cultural and racial tolerance and to continue to invest in the multicultural fabric of the nation. And we have done this. We have invested in the cultural diversity of this country and we have legislated to protect the victims of prejudice. We have not turned a blind eye to racism—and we will not compromise the principle of non- discrimination in immigration by erecting new barriers which discriminate against family reunion for our Non-English Speaking Background communities. We introduced and passed legislation that ensured the right to sexual privacy for all Australians.',

      "JOURNALIST: Mr. Rudd, do you accept the premise that some people have that there is a growing or there is a level of racism in Australia, particularly among young people that may be linked with this? (Inaudible) Do you accept that? And if you do, you say that you are doing everything you can to address this. What will you do about that? PRIME MINISTER: Well firstly, I don't accept your premise. I don't accept that there is, to use your term, a growing racism in the Australian society. Australia is a proud multicultural society. Australia is the home to some 300 languages, Australia is the home to something like 43 per cent of our population either being born abroad or one of whose parents were born abroad.",
