# Project Description

The producers of The Lucky Country acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the Lands on which this work was develop on and pay respects to Elders past, present and emerging.

The Lucky Country is a text based digital artwork examining Australia's collective views of our First Nations and multicultural communities through the sentiments of those elected to represent us. In doing so it does not seek to highlight a political divide nor elevate one party above another (all quotes appear unattributed) but establish whether there exists an overall societal discourse and look at how this has changed over the years. Through this, The Lucky Country examines whether Australia's luck and prosperity are endeared to all who seek it.

# Data Story

The Lucky Country uses sentiment analysis against the language of our nation’s leaders, through scraping politicians’ speeches to identify language associated with race and racism alongside the correlating year of release. This sentiment analysis bolds key phrases within presented quotes – highlighting themes for viewers to dwell upon. Through this The Lucky Country encourages all of us fortunate to call Australia home, to consider the prevalence of themes of race and racism in the speeches of our nation’s leaders and what this means for our society as a whole. Do the mentions of race indicate a persistence of racism in our culture? Do the mouths of our national representatives truly represent where we want to head as a community and society? How can we make Australia The Lucky Country for all?
